## Anti-Foreign Influence Act

All members of an O5 Council and above from an SCP genre group with over 10k members may not hold a high ranking position within the Nova Corporation or become a Department of Operations agent. Other positions of influence such as “Site Director” may also be barred, but such cases will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis by the Class - X Overwatch.
