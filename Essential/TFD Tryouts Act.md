Tryouts should look for a personality profile that fits the needs of the TFD, that being someone who is willing to be active, work with teammates, adapt from mistakes and with a passion for the specialisation they're trying out for.

Tryouts should not focus on elimination. When you join a tryout, you shouldn't be expected to have the experience of someone who's been in the TFD for a year.

Tryouts should therefore not eliminate people based on results and instead eliminate them based on traits such as improper communication (doesn't speak at all or talks over people frequently or disruptively), intelligence (don't run towards a hostile entity...) etc.

Tryouts can still maintain basic standards depending on the host / TFD obviously, but these should be objective and not include things like "winner of 1v1" etc.
