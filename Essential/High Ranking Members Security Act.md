## High Ranking Members Security Act

This act aims to implement various security measures that should be considered when looking at promoting someone to High Rank positions. In total there would be 4 main security measures in place that may prevent someone being promoted you can find these below:

1: Age Verification
All aspiring High Ranks MUST be “Age Verified” / Phone verified on Roblox and have 4k messages between their Departments discord and the main Nova Corporation discord.

2: Time in Department
All department members looking to become a High Rank must have served in their department for at least ONE month.

3: Discord Moderation Logs
Those who are looking to become a High Rank must have a clean track record in their NC Discord moderation Logs. Individuals must not have any repeated (3+) minor punishments such as basic warnings, kicks or a 24h ban. They may also not have any major previous punishments such as a Permanent ban leading up to their HRSMA background check. DoO would only look at the last year of moderation logs from the day they get proposed to become HR, anything past that year will not be factored in.

4: Class-E Logs
Those who are looking to become a High Rank may not have more than 2 minor Class -E sentences and no major Class - E sentences. A minor CE is defined as under 4 days and a major CE is defined as 5+ days. DoO would only look at the last year of CE logs from the day they get proposed to become HR, anything past that year will not be factored in.

This procedure will be handled by the Department of Operations. All requests for potential HRs to be background checked are to be sent to high ranking DoO members (Drone+) till a proper channel is set up in the DoO Public Server.
