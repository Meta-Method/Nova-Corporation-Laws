## Application Eligibility Decency Act

Departments may not refuse applications that fall under the following conditions:

**- Lack of grammar / frequent mispellings**

**Reasoning:** A lot of people might not be a native english speaker, and are bound to make multiple mistakes. The only situation where grammar / mispellings should result in a denied application, is when the application is barely readable (as in, takes genuine effort to comprehend) or when it is clearly a troll. (e.g. spam)

**- SCP mentions**

**Reasoning:** People who join with previous knowledge of the SCP genre will instinctively mention SCPs. Besides, given Class - D is the minimum entry rank for any department, people who apply for a department have already been vetoed through this step before. Confusion in wording between SCPs and entities, Foundation and Corporation, SD and SC, etc. should be acceptable. Instead of rejecting, guide them upon acceptance on how they're doing these terms wrong and what the correct way of naming things is.

Additionally, to combat improper enforcement of this act, or simple incompetence from application readers, a higher ranked member than the first rank that can read applications must review each denied application. This can be done by more than one person if needed. If a denied application is deemed incorrectly rejected, this high rank may request the person to be invited to the department (whether by delegating this to someone else with permissions to accept people to handle, or by doing it themselves).
