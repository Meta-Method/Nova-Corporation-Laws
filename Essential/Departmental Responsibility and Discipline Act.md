## Departmental Responsibility and Discipline Act

With new waves of new members guaranteed to arrive to Nova in the future, we must ensure we uphold the conditions necessary to maintain a good environment for the retention of these new members. Plus, to safeguard departmental duties, it is imperative that discipline prevails.

As such, under this act:
1. Those in a TFD (Task Force Detachment) that violate the AoS or their department's guidelines must be faced with a strike. If accidental, this can be lowered to a formal warning. If said member is the starting rank in the TFD (e.g. a Cadet in Iron Fist), then they must be exiled from the TFD and undergo a blacklist for at least **1** week.
2. There must be a minimum of **1 week** stay in the Security Corps and a minimum rank of **Junior Guard** before one can tryout for a TFD. Regardless of previous duration in the Security Corps.
3. There must be a minimum of **3 months** in a department before being able to receive a Veteran role, regardless of previous stay in the department. This applies to TFDs independently as well (e.g. must have been in the TFD for at least 3 months before getting a Veteran role in the TFD).
4. Severe infractions such as repeated inappropriate remarks, slurs, targeted harassment among others should result in an immediate exile from a TFD if it is coming from someone in one.
5. TFDs and departmental high ranks / high command must act cordially around people who are not within their direct circle, using grammar, being polite, etc. - for example, if a TFD member is next to ID or TS, they must act appropriately, but it is fine to be casual if you're only around your own TFD teammates.
6. Those caught stirring up drama in-game, in channels, or in voice chats, or intentionally conducting activities or messages that directly or indirectly result in other players leaving the game or department, are to receive a strike in their department (if in a TFD, then both SC and the TFD).
7. Should a necessary HiCOM figure for a department or TFD find themselves requiring to be absent, they must nominate a 2iC to take over during their inactivity period.
