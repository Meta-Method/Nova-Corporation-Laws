## "Lore Event" Authority & Command

This act aims to define which departments and which ranks among them hold authority and when.

**Innovation Department**

During lore events, Innovation Department will hold authority over how to proceed and operations and how to respond to the event. This will only be provided to Expert Innovator+. In the event that one is not present, command will fall to The Crazies Pointmen+, then the Department of Operations personnel and Security Corps Officers.
The Innovation Department will be the "bottom-line" for research events. If there is any research to be done, any anomalies, or anything new that ID would realistically be involved in, is when the chain of command above is followed. However, this can be overridden by other scenarios.

**Security Corps & Department of Operations**

During lore events which concern the well-being of the site, the Security Corps and Department of Operations will share a joint command. At the top is SC Directorate and DoO (Rank in DoO to be internally decided by Fish and A28), below that would be Security Corps Officers, then TC / NTSH, and then IF, TAG, and Mainforce.
At no times should a civil department hold any authority beyond RECOMMENDING certain actions when these situations happen. Lore events which concern the well-being of the site is primarily defined as events where an anomalous effect is hindering the site, site-wide. Additionally, GoI's other than the Nova Corporation itself which are capable of damaging site operations, such as TND.


Regulations Department and Engineering Department personnel would have no position in the hierarchy, with the exception of Department Directorate. If authority is being abused or it is believed that it will go poorly, Directorate may seize authority over the situation.
